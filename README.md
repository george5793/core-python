<h1>Python Challenge - Vending Machine</h1>

A program that utilises concepts learnt in the python module of my Code Institute course.

The program simulates a vending machine and determines what change to provide the user depending on what the amount is of the product they have selected.

Tests have also been written to assert whether the program is working as designed.
